# Tree
Create A new Node Class, a BinaryTree Class, and a BinarySearchTreeClass

## Challenge
Create three new classes:  

1. A new version of the node class. This will hav e a value, property, as well as a left and right child Node property.  

2. A BinaryTree Class. This will have a Root property, as well as thee traversal methods which will return an array matching the correct order of traversal. These orders are PreOrder, InOrder, and PostOrder. The tree should be read either Root-Left-Right, Left-Root-Right, or Left-Right-Root, respectively.

3. A BinarySearchTree Class. This will be similar to the BinaryTree Class, but will have an Add and Contains method that will either add a new node in the appropriate place, by comparing it with the other nodes. or Contains, which will return a boolean if a given value is found anywhere within the search tree.

## Approach & Efficiency
I was very confident with my whiteboard for this one, and even thought I had some ways of shaving down my efficiencies, but when I started coding and testing, I realized nothing quite worked as I expected, and I ran out of time trying to figure out the issue.
